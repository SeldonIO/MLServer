# MLServer

An open source inference server for your machine learning models.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeldonIO/MLServer/master/docs/assets/mlserver-logo.png)

## Overview

MLServer aims to provide an easy way to start serving your machine learning
models through a REST and gRPC interface, fully compliant with [KFServing's V2
Dataplane](https://github.com/kubeflow/kfserving/blob/master/docs/predict-api/v2/required_api.md)
spec.

You can read more about the goals of this project on the [inital design
document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C2uf4SaAtwLTlBCciOhvdiKQ2Eay4U72VxAD4bXe7iU/edit?usp=sharing).

## Usage

You can install the `mlserver` package running:

```bash
pip install mlserver
```

Note that to use any of the optional [inference runtimes](#Inference-Runtimes),
you'll need to install the relevant package.
For example, to serve a `scikit-learn` model, you would need to install the
`mlserver-sklearn` package:

```bash
pip install mlserver-sklearn
```

For further information on how to use MLServer, you can check any of the
[available examples](#examples).

## Inference Runtimes

Inference runtimes allow you to define how your model should be used within
MLServer.
You can think of them as the **backend glue** between MLServer and your machine
learning framework of choice.
You can read more about [inference runtimes in their documentation
page](./docs/runtimes/index.md).

Out of the box, MLServer comes with a set of pre-packaged runtimes which let
you interact with a subset of common frameworks.
This allows you to start serving models saved in these frameworks straight
away.

Out of the box, MLServer provides support for:

## Developer Guide

### Versioning

Both the main `mlserver` package and the [inference runtimes
packages](./docs/runtimes/index.md) try to follow the same versioning schema.
To bump the version across all of them, you can use the
[`./hack/update-version.sh`](./hack/update-version.sh) script.
For example:

```bash
./hack/update-version.sh 0.2.0.dev1
```
