# NOTE: This requirements.txt file is required to set up our RTD environment.
# Therefore, it follows a couple weird conventions that are required by RTD
# which also make it hard to use locally (thus why it's split in two
# requirements.txt files).
# For example, it must be called from the top-level folder to # align with how
# RTD works (except for `-r` lines, which get converted to relative on-the-fly
# by RTD).

.
# NOTE: Both the Alibi-Detect and Huggingface runtimes show a generated
# reference of the available settings - therefore, they need to be
# available on the environment.
