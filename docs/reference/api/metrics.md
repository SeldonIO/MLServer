# Metrics

The MLServer package exposes a set of methods that let you register and track
custom metrics.
This can be used within your own [custom inference
runtimes](../../user-guide/custom).
To learn more about how to expose custom metrics, check out the [metrics usage
guide](../../user-guide/metrics).

```{eval-rst}
.. automodule:: mlserver
   :members: register, log
```
