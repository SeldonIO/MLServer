# Python API

MLServer can be installed as a Python package, which exposes a public
framework which can be used to build [custom inference
runtimes](../../user-guide/custom) and [codecs](../../user-guide/content-type).

Below, you can find the main reference for the Python API exposed by the
MLServer framework.
