## Overview

MLServer aims to provide an easy way to start serving your machine learning
models through a REST and gRPC interface, fully compliant with [KFServingâ€™s V2
Dataplane](https://docs.seldon.io/projects/seldon-core/en/latest/reference/apis/v2-protocol.html)
spec. Watch a quick video introducing the project [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZHe3z-8C_w).

- Multi-model serving, letting users run multiple models within the same
  process.
- Ability to run [inference in parallel for vertical
  scaling](https://mlserver.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/parallel-inference.html)
  across multiple models through a pool of inference workers.
- Support for [adaptive
  batching](https://mlserver.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/adaptive-batching.html),
  to group inference requests together on the fly.
- Scalability with deployment in Kubernetes native frameworks, including
  [Seldon Core](https://docs.seldon.io/projects/seldon-core/en/latest/graph/protocols.html#v2-kfserving-protocol) and
  [KServe (formerly known as KFServing)](https://kserve.github.io/website/modelserving/v1beta1/sklearn/v2/), where
  MLServer is the core Python inference server used to serve machine learning
  models.
- Support for the standard [V2 Inference Protocol](https://docs.seldon.io/projects/seldon-core/en/latest/reference/apis/v2-protocol.html) on
  both the gRPC and REST flavours, which has been standardised and adopted by
  various model serving frameworks.

You can read more about the goals of this project on the [initial design
document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C2uf4SaAtwLTlBCciOhvdiKQ2Eay4U72VxAD4bXe7iU/edit?usp=sharing).

## Usage

You can install the `mlserver` package running:

```bash
pip install mlserver
```

Note that to use any of the optional [inference runtimes](),
youâ€™ll need to install the relevant package.
For example, to serve a `scikit-learn` model, you would need to install the
`mlserver-sklearn` package:

```bash
pip install mlserver-sklearn
```

For further information on how to use MLServer, you can check any of the
[available examples]().

## Inference Runtimes

Inference runtimes allow you to define how your model should be used within
MLServer.
You can think of them as the **backend glue** between MLServer and your machine
learning framework of choice.
You can read more about inference runtimes in their documentation
page.

Out of the box, MLServer comes with a set of pre-packaged runtimes which let
you interact with a subset of common frameworks.
This allows you to start serving models saved in these frameworks straight
away.
However, itâ€™s also possible to **write custom
runtimes**.

Out of the box, MLServer provides support for:

## Developer Guide

### Versioning

Both the main `mlserver` package and the inference runtimes
packages try to follow the same versioning schema.
To bump the version across all of them, you can use the
[`./hack/update-version.sh`](../hack/update-version.sh) script.

We generally keep the version as a placeholder for an upcoming version.

For example:

```bash
./hack/update-version.sh 0.2.0.dev1
```

### Testing

To run all of the tests for MLServer and the runtimes, use:

```bash
make test
```

To run run tests for a single file, use something like:

```bash
tox -e py3 -- tests/batch_processing/test_rest.py
```
