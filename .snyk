# Ignore CVEs with no upgrade path that are either disputed by the vendor or
# where the vendor has not provided any resolution ETA.
ignore:
  # The CVEs below are introduced by JARs bundled within PySpark's Python
  # package.
  # Therefore, even though there is a corresponding upgrade path for the JARs
  # themselves, these are out of our control.
