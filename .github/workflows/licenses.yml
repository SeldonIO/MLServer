            # License Change Detected :warning:
            There was a license change detected.\n
            Most likely, this has been triggered due to a licensing change in
            one of our subdependencies, or the introducing of a new
            subdependency.\n
            This automated PR re-generates the licenses to keep them up to
            date."
