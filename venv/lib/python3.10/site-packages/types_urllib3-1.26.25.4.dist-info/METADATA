## Typing stubs for urllib3

This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the `urllib3` package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like mypy, PyCharm, pytype etc. to check code
that uses `urllib3`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/urllib3. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `0fbe70f709196a12462f1417d559f3436ce2b4d5`.
