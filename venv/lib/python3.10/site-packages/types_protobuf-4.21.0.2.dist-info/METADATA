## Typing stubs for protobuf

This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the `protobuf` package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like mypy, PyCharm, pytype etc. to check code
that uses `protobuf`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/protobuf. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

Generated with aid from mypy-protobuf v3.4.0

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `cdf5cc34f285eddf857299fb27fa170980a06dba`.
